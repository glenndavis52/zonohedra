abstract = {Abstract The chromaticity diagram associated with the 1931 2° CIE color-matching functions is shown to be slightly non-convex. While having no impact on practical colorimetric computations, the non-convexity does have a significant impact on the shape of some optimal object color reflectance distributions located on the outer surface of the object color solid. Instead of the usual two-transition Schrödinger form, many optimal colors exhibit higher transition counts. A linear programming formulation is developed and is used to locate where these higher-transition optimal object colors reside on the object color solid surface. The regions of higher-transition count appear to have a point-symmetric, complementary structure. The high-transition behavior is shown to be largely absent in more modern color-matching functions, such as the recent “physiologically-relevant” color-matching functions transformed from cone fundamentals.},
