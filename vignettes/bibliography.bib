abstract = {Abstract This article demonstrates that the CIE XYZ colour solid is a zonoid. An approximating zonohedral colour solid is constructed explicitly from a set of generating vectors, which are integrals of colour-matching functions over narrow intervals of the visible spectrum. The zonohedral approach yields an intuitive, constructive proof of the Optimal Colour Theorem: the reflectance function of an optimal colour takes on only the values 0 or 1, with at most two transition wavelengths. In addition, zonohedral techniques can simplify computations: for example, optimal colours can be found without calculating transition wavelengths. Finally, zonohedra provide a simple, unified approach to colour space and eliminate much of the confusion arising from chromaticity diagrams. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 2013},

abstract = {Abstract The chromaticity diagram associated with the 1931 2° CIE color-matching functions is shown to be slightly non-convex. While having no impact on practical colorimetric computations, the non-convexity does have a significant impact on the shape of some optimal object color reflectance distributions located on the outer surface of the object color solid. Instead of the usual two-transition Schrödinger form, many optimal colors exhibit higher transition counts. A linear programming formulation is developed and is used to locate where these higher-transition optimal object colors reside on the object color solid surface. The regions of higher-transition count appear to have a point-symmetric, complementary structure. The high-transition behavior is shown to be largely absent in more modern color-matching functions, such as the recent “physiologically-relevant” color-matching functions transformed from cone fundamentals.},
